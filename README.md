cd WearSphere-Ecommerce-MERN
```

### 2. Install dependencies

cd ../admin && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
```
### Environment Variables Setup
To run the project locally, you need to set up environment variables for both frontend and backend.

## 1. Frontend (frontend/.env):
VITE_BACKEND_URL: URL of your backend API (e.g., http://localhost:4000 for local development).

VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID: Razorpay Key ID for payment integration.

Example .env file for the frontend:
```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
```
## 2. Backend (backend/.env):

MONGODB_URI: MongoDB connection string.
JWT_SECRET: Secret for JWT authentication.
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY, CLOUDINARY_NAME: For Cloudinary image uploads.
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: For Stripe payments.
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET: Razorpay secret key.
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID: Razorpay Key ID.
ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD: Admin login credentials for the admin panel.

Example .env file for the backend:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY=your_cloudinary_secret_key
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```

### Running the Application Locally
After setting up the .env files, you can run the application locally:

# 1. Start Backend:
In the backend/ directory, run the following command to start the backend:
```bash
npm start
```
By default, it will run on http://localhost:4000. Make sure the backend is running before starting the frontend.

# 2. Start Frontend:
In the frontend/ directory, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the frontend on http://localhost:3000.

# 3. Start Admin Panel:
In the admin/ directory, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the admin panel on http://localhost:5000.

# Now, you can access:
The user panel at http://localhost:3000
The admin panel at http://localhost:5000
The backend at http://localhost:4000
